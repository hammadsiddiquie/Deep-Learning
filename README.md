This project aims to predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The dataset includes customer behavioral data, and the goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service. The project involves data preprocessing, handling missing values, converting categorical data, and training a deep learning model using Keras and TensorFlow. The model achieves a classification accuracy of 78%, with further potential for optimization.
